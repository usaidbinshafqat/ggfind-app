# ggfind-app
A VueJS web app that I developed  using CheapShark's API. It searches for PC games at different online stores and picks the cheapest deal available for that game.


#How to use
Use the autocomplete search bar at the top of the app to look for a PC game and click enter. 

#Result
It will return a card which displays cheapest deal according to CheapShark followed by the game being offered at other stores (if any).
